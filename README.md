## How to install our project
### Requirements
- [Anaconda for Python 3.6 version](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) My version is 4.3.21
- Django My version is 1.11.6
- [XAMPP using PHP5](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) My version XAMPP for Windows 5.6.32
### Environment
I do all works at Windows10 and make sure it can run following the instruction. Sorry for I do not have a mac or linux to test, but since I only use Anaconda and XAMPP which are all have distribution for MacOS and Linux, and add Django package via pip, I believe it also can run through the steps.
